- 404 error for redirecting after posting a review for a board game
- adding image column (rather than undo migrating)
- heroku
- dom manipulation (played status and gameShelves)



TODO
- seed reviews
- add image column
- S & M: continue reviews (new, edit, delete), nav bar, buttons
- B & J: continue gameShelves, look at how to add boardGames to lists, look into DOM manipulation
